Currently, I hope interested person like you can help or cooperate with me to improve following aspects:

- Support for mainstream databases (e.g. SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and so on).

- Recommender's Performance Judging Module: give scientific and reasonable judgement to recommender's performance (the theory better comes from a peer-reviewed paper or textbook).

- Support for English news recommendation.

- More robost collaborative filtering recommendation results.
